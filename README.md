# IBM final project "Data Analysis with Python"

Welcome to my final project for the **"Data Analysis with Python"** course! In this repository, you will find a data analysis of house sale prices in King County. The project consists of **essential stages**, such as Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Development, and Model Evaluation.

To conduct this analysis, we used some of the main Python libraries, such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, **numpy**, and **seaborn**. These tools helped us with **data manipulation, visualization of graphs, numerical calculations, and model creation to evaluate the obtained information.**

Feel free to explore the files, review the code, and check the analysis results. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for following my progress in this project, and I hope it can also be useful for other data analysis enthusiasts using Python or students of the course! :heart:
